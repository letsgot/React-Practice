<!-- The crossorigin attribute in a <script> or <link> tag is used to handle cross-origin requests in web browsers. It is particularly useful when you are loading resources (like JavaScript or CSS) from a different origin (domain) than the one your website is hosted on.

    Let's break down the CDN link and the crossorigin attribute:
    
    1. CDN Link:
    A CDN (Content Delivery Network) link provides access to resources hosted on a remote server that can be accessed by browsers. For example, using a CDN link for React allows you to include the React library without having to download and serve it yourself.
    
    2. crossorigin Attribute:
    The crossorigin attribute controls how browsers handle cross-origin requests, which occur when your webpage requests resources from a different origin. By default, a request made to another domain is considered cross-origin. -->
